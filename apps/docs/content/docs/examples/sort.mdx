## Default sorting

For enabling sorting you need to set `sorting` property in `useTable` hook arguments.

```tsx
const { sort } = useTable({
  //...
  columns,
  sorting: {
    sortable: true,
  },
});
```

Default sorting allows you to sort by any column by clicking on the column header.

## Custom sorting

Sorting can be customized by setting `sorting` in `useTable` as follows:

```tsx
const { sort, setSort } = useTable({
  //...
  columns,
  sorting: {
    sortable: true,
    type: "custom",
  },
});
```

By doing this you will have full control over sorting. You can use `setSort` to set sorting state and `sort` to get the current sorting state.
